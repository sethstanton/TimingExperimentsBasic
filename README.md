# TimingExperimentsBasic
Here is a basic timing experiment that can be shifted to work with different sorting algorithms. 
So far I have implemented Selection, Bingo, Bubble, Insertion, and BogoSort to work with this timing experiment.
The experiment works by creating a randomized array of a customisable length/max value and sorting it.
The time is measured from how long it takes to sort the array and is converted into seconds from nanoseconds.
